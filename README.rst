AItomic
=======

``AItomic`` is a Python library developed by the `AIchemy Hub`_ for making AI
in chemistry simple. As a chemical researcher, you likely do not want to spend
your time thinking about how to organize your data or collect it from various
sources. Most likely, you want to do write simple function call and get access
to all your data in a data frame. Well, thats what ``AItomic`` does for
you. Currently, the library provides tools for accessing your NMR data 
stored in a `NOMAD NMR <https://www.nomad-nmr.uk>`_ server.

For more documentation make sure to check out our `docs
<https://aitomic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. There's lots of examples and
it's easy to get started.
